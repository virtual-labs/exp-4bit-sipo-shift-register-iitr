#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Choose the SIPO Register. <br> | Display the simulator window for SIPO.<br> | To perform an experiment on a particular register.<br>
2.| Click the clock button to input.  <br>  |  Show the output result which will be added in the table. <br>  | To check the knowledge of the operation of register.<br>
3.| Click the output button to check the output. <br> | Clear all the input and Output Fields. <br> | To provide space for further entries. <br>
